(https://github.com/ "GitHub") provides hosting for software development version control using Git. If you don't have an account go and create one (/assets/images/its-free.jpg " it's free").

**Which type of website can host GitHub**
Take in mind that we are going to store a website in a Git repo, so don't expect advaced functionaIlities beyond some javascript and images.

You can host a:
+ Blog
+ Curriculum Vitae
+ Project documentation

**Let's start**

1. Sig up for GitHub (if you don't have an account)
2. Create a new repository (public) following this pattern (mygithubuser.mygithubuser.github.io)
⋅⋅1. As you can see the name of the repo should be the same as the user
⋅⋅2. After the repo name add .github.io
